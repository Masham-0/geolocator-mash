geolocator - Workout Tracker
geolocator is a workout logging application that combines interactive maps with geolocation and local storage to deliver a dynamic user experience.

Features
Geolocation Integration: Automatically detects and centers the map on the user's current location using the browser's geolocation API.

Interactive Mapping: Log running or cycling workouts by clicking on the map. Each workout is marked with a popup pin and listed in a sidebar.

Dynamic Form Handling: The form dynamically updates based on the selected workout type (e.g., cadence for running, elevation for cycling).

Persistent Data: All workouts and map markers are saved in the browser's local storage, so data remains available after reloading the page.

Responsive UI: Clicking a workout in the sidebar pans the map to its corresponding location.
